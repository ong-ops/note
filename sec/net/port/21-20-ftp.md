# FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

- Transfer files over a network but unexcrypted any data
- Use a client-server model
- FTP session operates 2 channels
  - a command or the control channel (TCP port 20)
  - a data channel (TCP port 21)
- Active vs Passive connections
  - Active FTP connection, the client opens a port and listens. The server is required to actively connect to it
  - Passive FTP connection, the server opens a port and listens (passively) and the client connects to it
 - Anonymous account
