## RDBMS

- A software or service are used to create and manage databases based on a relational model.
- The word `relational` means the data stored in the dataset is organised as tables.

## How does MySQL work?

- The server handles all database instructions like creating, editing, accessing data.
- It takes and manages these requests and communicates using the MySQL protocol.
- MySQL stages:
  1. MySQL creates a database for storing and manipulating data, defining the relationship of each table
  2. Clients make requests by making specific statements in SQL
  3. The server will respond to the client with whatever info has been requested
