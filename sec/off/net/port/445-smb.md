- Port 445
- A client-server communication protocol used for sharing access to files, printers, serial ports and other resources on a network
- Response - Request protocol transmit multiple messages between the client and server to establish a connection
- Client using NBT, IPX/SPX, NBF
- TCP port 445, NetBT port 137 138 139
- Use `Kerberos` protocol to authen users against `Active Directory` on Windows domain networks
- Opportunistic locking (OpLocks)
  - Improve file performance
  - Controlling caching of network files by the client
  - Types
    - Batch Locks
      - support DOS batch file execution operation which the file is opened and closed many times in a short period
      - Client ask for OpLock type `batch`
      - Client delays sending the close request and if subsequent open request is given, the 2 requests cancel each other
    - Level-1 OpLocks / Exclusive Locks
      - When app open in `shared mode` a file hosted on SMB server which is not opened by other process/clients
      - The client receives an `exclusive OpLock` from the server
    - Level-2 OpLocks
      - Like Level 1 but allow other client write/read access
    - Filter OpLocks
      - Like Level 2 but prevent sharing-mode violations between file open and lock reception
      - MS advises use only where it is important to allow multiple readers and Level 2 in other circumstances
    - Breaks
      - A break request may be sent from server to client.
      - Informs the client that OpLock is not longer valid
